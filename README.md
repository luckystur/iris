Project Overview: Iris Flower Species Classification

Objective: Analyzed and classified Iris flower species using various machine learning algorithms.

Tools Used: Employed Python libraries such as pyforest, sklearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Loaded the Iris dataset and performed exploratory data analysis. Visualized data using scatter plots, line plots, box plots, joint plots, and more.

Utilized different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes variants.

Model Evaluation: Split the data into training and testing sets. Trained each classifier, predicted on test data, and evaluated accuracy. Computed classification report and confusion matrix for each algorithm.

Classifier Comparison: Created a DataFrame to compare accuracy and log loss of each classifier. Visualized the comparison using a bar plot.

Project Purpose: The project aimed to classify Iris flower species using a variety of classification algorithms, providing insights into their performance and assisting in selecting the most suitable model for this particular dataset.
